News Meme generator
----

This is a simple meme generator for articles published from [topolitque.ch](http://www.topolitique.ch) destined for sharing them on various social media platforms. It is inspired from Vox's [meme project](https://github.com/voxmedia/meme), however 

It is implemented solely on html5 and js, thus saving the cost of running a server side image-editing system as all the computing is done on the client side, while keeping the advantages of the web : easy usage by anyone, and continuous updates on the code.

##  TODO - v.2 (planned 30/01/2019):
* Change text drawing functions (prepare text, then draw, to know the size it takes)
* Enable support for options (functions should also take into account the options)
* Draw one image rather than all, thus skimming duplicate code
* Find out about multiple authors standard with `meta`tags
* Implement Twitter and Facebook images (right now only insta stories and feed)
* Make it more general (less focused on *TOPO*), compatible with most articles
